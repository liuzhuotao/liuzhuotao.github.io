abstract: "Defending against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is a fundamental problem in the Internet. Over the past few decades, the research and industry communities have proposed a variety of solutions, from adding incremental capabilities to the existing Internet routing stack, to clean-slate future Internet architectures, and to widely deployed commercial DDoS prevention services. Yet a recent interview with over 100 security practitioners in multiple sectors reveals that existing solutions are still insufficient against , due to either unenforceable protocol deployment or non-comprehensive traffic filters. This seemingly endless arms race with attackers probably means that we need a fundamental paradigm shift. In this paper, we propose a new DDoS prevention paradigm named preference-driven and in-network enforced traffic shaping , aiming to explore the novel DDoS prevention norms that focus on delivering victim-preferred traffic rather than consistently chasing after the DDoS attacks. Towards this end, we propose DFNet , a novel DDoS prevention system that provides reliable delivery of victim-preferred traffic without full knowledge of DDoS attacks. At a very high level, the core innovative design of DFNet embraces the advances in Machine Learning (ML) and new network dataplane primitives, by encoding the victimâ€™s traffic preference (in the form of complex ML models) into dataplane packet scheduling algorithms such that the victim-preferred traffic is forwarded with priority at line-speed, regardless of the attacker strategy. We implement a prototype of DFNet in 11,560 lines of code, and extensively evaluate it on our testbed. The results show that a single instance of DFNetDFNet can forward 99.93% of victim-desired traffic when facing previously unseen attacks, while imposing less than 0.1% forwarding overhead on a dataplane with 80 Gbps upstream links and a 40 Gbps bottleneck."
