Directly addressing the deeper long term problems of the Internet as a non profit is an incredible act of bravery and selflessness that benefits all of us. ISRG is doing the work to rebuild the underpinnings of the Internet so they are strong and resilient. We can build even bigger, greater things on that foundation"

For better or worse, a lot of software is focused on the next release or the imminent security bugs. But the kind of long-term thinking in which you start the project thinking you will have an impact in 10 yearsâ€”it is so rare to have that kind of thinking."
